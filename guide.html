      <p>Shopping for health insurance is a bit like buying a plane ticket. Just like you compare options to find the cheapest flight that still gets you to your destination smoothly, you want to find the health plan with the best coverage at the lowest price. The problem is there&rsquo;s no Orbitz or Expedia for health insurance.</p>

      <p>With the 2018 open enrollment period here, we compiled a guide below to help residents of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County choose the best health insurance plan.</p>

            <h1>Here are five things you <u>need</u> to know about buying health insurance for 2018:</h1> 
            <ul>
              <li>The open enrollment period runs from Nov. 1, 2017 to Dec. 15, 2017.</li>
              <li>In Allegheny County, there are 34 different plans available on the HealthCare.gov marketplace, primarily offered by two providers: UPMC Health Plan and Highmark. </li>
              <li>The health insurance plans available to you and their prices change based on your age and income.</li>
              <li>Preexisting conditions are covered. You cannot be denied a plan in the marketplace based on a preexisting condition. </li>
              <li>Have an insurance plan through the marketplace? If you do nothing, you will be re-enrolled in the same plan. Due to several changes, you may want to shop around before re-enrolling because you could get better coverage for less.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Follow our guide below for more explanation of the options and available resources.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h1>Understanding your health insurance options</h1>
        <h2><span class="highlight">Can’t I just change my health insurance any time?</span></h2>
        <p>No. The open enrollment period, which ends Dec. 15, is the designated time frame to enroll in or change your health insurance coverage for 2018. Outside of this period, you can only change your insurance under a few special circumstances, such as a birth of a child or change in job status.</p>
        <h2><span class="highlight">Are there ways to get health insurance other than in the federal marketplace? </span></h2>
        <p>Yes. It is helpful to understand all of the options before you start shopping:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b class="mallory">Health insurance plans from the federal marketplace.</b> Find these plans at <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov" target="_blank">www.healthcare.gov</a>.</li>
                <li>You can buy <b class="mallory">direct from the health insurance providers</b>. In Allegheny County, that’s only UPMC Health Plan and Highmark. You can shop directly from UPMC Health Plan or Highmark, use a broker or shop one of the other online marketplaces such as ehealthinsurance.com.</li>
                <li><b class="mallory">Employer-provided plans</b>: Your employer may choose a plan and make a contribution toward the premium.</li>
                <li><b class="mallory">No insurance</b>: The Affordable Care Act stipulates that everyone must have qualifying health coverage or pay a fee. If you’re uninsured, you will be responsible for the Individual Shared Responsibility Payment. You will have to pay 2.5 percent of your income or $695 per person, whichever is higher. The maximum fee is $2,085 per person.
                <li><b class="mallory"><a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/medicaid/"  target="_blank">Medicaid</a></b>: Free or low-cost health insurance coverage for low-income residents.</li>
                <li><b class="mallory"><a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/medicare/"  target="_blank">Medicare</a></b>: Federal health insurance for adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities. You can switch from your marketplace plan to Medicare. More information is available <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/medicare/changing-from-marketplace-to-medicare/"  target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                <li><b class="mallory">Health care sharing ministry</b>: The Affordable Care Act states that individuals who are members of a health care sharing ministry are exempt from the individual healthcare mandate. <a href="http://www.medicalcostshare.com/comparison-of-major-healthcare-sharing-ministries.html"  target="_blank">Health care sharing ministries</a> are not insurance plans; they are a group of members who share the costs of the medical expenses. Unlike the marketplace, individuals can be excluded for a preexisting condition. To participate, you have to be a Christian and agree to live a Christian lifestyle, which includes no smoking, no illegal drugs, no abuse of alcohol and regular participation in worship.</li>
              </ul>

      <h1>Things to know before you shop for health insurance...</h1>
        <h2><span class="highlight">Your age determines your options.</span></h2>
        <p>People 65 and older are eligible for Medicare, while people younger than 30 are eligible for catastrophic coverage — the least expensive insurance plan and the least coverage. Catastrophic insurance plans cover three primary care visits per year; everything else is paid out of pocket until a deductible is met. Children can be covered in family plans or under a federal health insurance program (more on that here).</p>

        <hr class="style11" />

        <h1>Your income changes what assistance is available to you.</h1>
        <h2><span class="highlight">You may be eligible for Medicaid or for savings in the marketplace.<br><br>Here’s how to find out:</span></h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Before you shop, you can use the Pennsylvania Health Law Project’s Quickscreen tool to see if you are eligible for Medicaid.</li>
              <li>If your income is between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, you are likely eligible for a discounted health insurance plan. INSERT TABLE</li>
              <li>Use the HealthCare.gov savings tool to see if your household is eligible for savings.
                <ul>
                  <li><span class="mallory">You’ll need to know your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)</span>
                    <ul>
                      <li>AGI is listed on your tax returns. (On Form 1040, see Line 37. On Form 1040 EZ, see Line 4. On Form 1040 A, see Line 21.)</li>
                      <li>The Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is your AGI + untaxed foreign income, non-taxable Social Security benefits and tax-exempt interest. For many people, your MAGI will be the same amount as your AGI. When you create an account on HealthCare.gov to apply for health insurance, the website will walk you through the income requirements and determine your MAGI. </li>
                      <li>The health insurance marketplace subsidies and discounts are based on the MAGI.</li>
                      </li>
                    </ul>

        <h1>You’ll want to know what health insurance plans are accepted by doctors and providers you like.</h1>
        <p>It’s a good idea to make a list of your current doctors and be sure they’re in the network before you make your health insurance selection.</p>
        <p>A doctor's office may accept your insurance, but if your insurance plan considers them out of network, you will likely have to pay more.</p>
